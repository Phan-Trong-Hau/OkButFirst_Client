                  <p className="about-content">
                    Coffee is so much more than a drink that gives us that much
                    needed jolt throughout our day. It is one of the oldest
                    beverages that have long been bringing people together.
                    Coffee is part of the moments we create and the experiences
                    that unite us.
                  </p>

                  <p className="about-content">
                    Growing up in a big family, coffee has always been the
                    connection that bound us through our gatherings, the stories
                    we shared and memories we made. Far back as I can remember,
                    the aroma alone, permeating from the stovetop percolator,
                    was a signal that the night was far from over. It was an
                    excuse for us to linger longer and form deeper connections.
                    To say that we've grown a passion for coffee is an
                    understatement. And to this day, a freshly brewed cup of
                    coffee is something that somehow teleports us back to a
                    place or memory, while continuing to ignite new memories now
                    and in the future.

                    Coffee is that familiar friend we all know; that casual
                    encounter that allows us to foster comfortable relationships
                    between each other. Coffee is family. Coffee is friends.
                    Coffee is memories. Coffee is love. Ok, but first… coffee!

              <p className="about-content">
                Coffee plays a major role in our lives, and the center point
                of our connections. As such, having quality coffee is vital to
                helping create those experiences and memories. Back in the day,
                great coffee was not easy to come by. Options were limited, from
                the mass-produced brands stocked on grocery shelves, to the
                overpriced retail chain coffee shops we all have come to know.
                Even today, finding great coffee, seems to only happen by
                stumbling upon that random local roaster along our travels. For
                the majority, those local roasters aren’t easily accessible. And
                so, we simply got tired of drinking bland coffee and never
                finding a roast we truly loved.
              </p>
              <p className="about-content">
                Queue lightbulb moment… so we decided to launch our own coffee
                company and develop specialty coffee roasts to deliver directly
                to your door. Coffee we can truly be proud to drink and worthy
                of a coffee culture, that continues to enhance one another’s
                connections.

                  <p className="about-content">
                    As the popular legend goes, a goat herder from Kaffa (now
                    Ethiopia) named Kaldi was herding his goats, when he noticed
                    strange behavior from his herd. The goats, after eating
                    bright red berries from a certain tree, began to dance
                    around wildly and bleat loudly.
                  </p>
                  <p className="about-content">
                    Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local
                    monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that
                    it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer.
                    The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the
                    monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to
                    spread.

                  <p className="about-content">
                    As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian Peninsula,
                    it began a journey which would bring these beans across the
                    globe. And there you have it, the story of coffee discovery
